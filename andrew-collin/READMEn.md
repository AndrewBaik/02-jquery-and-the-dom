# JQUERY and the DOM

**Author**: Andrew and Collin
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 301 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
The purpose of lab 03 "JQUERY and the DOM" is for students to practice utilizing JQUERY library. Throughout this lab, my partner and I, gained better understanding of using JQUERY to edit and tag HTML elements and its contents, and use .forEach() as loop.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
I forked and cloned the class repo, created a new branch, copy and pasted starting code, and read through the starter code in prior to coding.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
In this application, my partner and I used Javascript language with JQUERY library attached. Also, this application is developed to be used in both desktop and mobile environments.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this are to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an examples: -->
